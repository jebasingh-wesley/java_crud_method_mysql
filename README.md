  - This API will save an employee in the employee database (inserts a record into the employee table).

- `GET /employee/getall`
  - This API will return details of all employees as a list.

- `GET /employee/getone/{employeeId}`
  - This API will return details of a specific employee based on the provided employee ID.

- `DELETE /employee/delete/{employeeId}`
  - This API will delete the employee with the provided employee ID (removes the record from the employee table).

- `PUT /employee/update`
  - This API will update the details of an employee (updates the employee table).

## Let's Test the API

### Import Project to IDE
First, clone the project from the GitHub repository and then open the project using IntelliJ:
- `File -> Open -> Select your project`

### Create the Database
Create a database named **employee** in your MySQL Workbench. You can create your own database; it doesnâ€™t have to be named **employee**. If you create a different database, make sure to update the database name in the property file accordingly. Update the database **username** and **password** according to your MySQL configuration.

```diff
- NOTE: 
You only need to create the database; do not create the tables. 
When you run the application, Hibernate will create the tables in the employee database for you.
```

Build and run your project. You can test all the API routes using Postman. Below are screenshots of API calls using Postman.
